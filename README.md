### Remake vcf file
Follow the steps on the `remake_vcf` page to make DGN files usable (the steps also lift it over to the newes Dmel genome building).

### Annotate vcf SNPs
One jupiter notebook in `annotate_vcf` folder that documents all the steps to annotate `.vcf` files.

### Create SFSs sets
Another jupyter notebooks in `sfs_vcf` folder with all steps to get the pairs of SFSs.
